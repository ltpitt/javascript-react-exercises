# Meet useEffect: Building Your Mental Math Game! üßÆ

Get ready to meet your new favorite hook! If `useState` is like giving your app memory, then `useEffect` is like giving your app a personal assistant who can generate new math problems automatically at just the right time.

## What mind-blowing thing you'll build

You're about to create an interactive mental math game that automatically generates new questions, keeps track of your score, and responds to your answers! It's like having a personal math tutor built right into your webpage.

You'll create:
- **An automatic question generator** - Your app will create new math problems without you having to ask
- **Smart score tracking** - Keep track of correct and incorrect answers automatically  
- **Interactive game mechanics** - True/False buttons that actually respond and keep the game moving
- **Dynamic content updates** - Watch questions change and scores update in real-time

## The incredible hook you're learning

*This might sound technical, but it's actually your app's superpower:*

- **useEffect**: Your app's personal assistant that can do things automatically (like generating new questions)
- **Side effects**: Cool things your app can do beyond just showing information (like creating random numbers)
- **Automatic timing**: Your assistant knows when to generate a new question without you telling it every time
- **Perfect coordination**: useState and useEffect working together like a perfect team

## Let's build your math game!

You're about to create an interactive game that's actually fun to play:

1. **Set up your game development environment**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *Getting ready to build your first game with React!*

2. **Launch your mental math game**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   *Time to see useEffect in action!*

3. **Start playing**: 
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and test your math skills!

4. **When you're done gaming**: `Ctrl+C` to stop

## The fun game you'll see (and fix!)

When your app loads, you'll find:

- The familiar "ReactND - Coding Practice" header with React logo
- A "Mental Math" game showing a math equation (like "5 + 3 = 8")
- "True" and "False" buttons (that currently don't do anything)
- A score display showing "Your Score: 0/0"

*Right now it's a static display, but you're going to make it into a real, working game!*

## Your game development mission üéÆ

**üéØ What's broken and needs your magic**: Right now this "game" has some problems:
1. It only shows one question that never changes
2. The buttons don't respond when you click them
3. The score never updates no matter what you do
4. There's no way to get new questions

**üîç Your gaming toolkit**: You'll use both hooks working together:
- **useState** to remember the current question, your score, and how many questions you've answered
- **useEffect** to automatically generate new math problems when you need them

**üí° The game mechanics you'll implement**:
- Click "True" or "False" to answer the math question
- Get instant feedback on whether you're right or wrong
- Watch your score update automatically
- See a brand new question appear immediately after you answer

**üöÄ Why this is so satisfying**: By the end, you'll have built a complete, playable game! But more importantly, you'll understand how to:
- Make apps that respond to user actions
- Generate content automatically with useEffect
- Coordinate multiple pieces of state working together
- Create engaging, interactive experiences

**üéØ Real-world application**: This same pattern powers every quiz app, game, and interactive educational tool. You're learning how to build experiences that keep users engaged and coming back for more!
