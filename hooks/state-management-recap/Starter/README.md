# Welcome to React Hooks: Building Your Chat App! üí¨

Congratulations on making it this far! You've been using something called "hooks" without even realizing it. Now it's time to put your hook skills to the test by building a real chat application!

## What amazing thing you'll build

Remember that `useState` thing you've been using to make your apps remember things? You're about to use it to build something really cool - a chat app where you can send messages and see conversations grow in real-time!

You'll create:
- **A working chat interface** - Just like texting apps you use every day
- **Multiple chat windows** - Handle several conversations at once
- **Smart form validation** - Buttons that know when they should work and when they shouldn't
- **Real-time message updates** - See your messages appear instantly as you send them

## The hook mastery you'll demonstrate

*Time to show off everything you've learned about hooks:*

- **useState expertise**: Manage multiple pieces of information (messages, input text, validation)
- **Form mastery**: Create inputs that are perfectly controlled by React
- **Event handling pro skills**: Respond to user actions like typing and clicking
- **State update wizardry**: Add new messages to your chat while keeping everything organized
- **Smart UI logic**: Make buttons enable and disable themselves based on what's happening

## Let's build your chat app!

You're about to build something that feels like a real messaging app:

1. **Set up your chat platform**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *Getting ready to build your own messaging app!*

2. **Launch your chat app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   *Time to see your chat interface come to life!*

3. **Start chatting**: 
   Head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start building conversations!

4. **When you're done chatting**: `Ctrl+C` to stop

## The cool chat interface you'll see

When your app loads, you'll find:

- The familiar "ReactND - Coding Practice" header with React logo
- A chat application interface with two separate chat windows
- Input fields where you can type messages
- Submit buttons (that need your useState magic to work properly!)

*Right now it's just the shell - you get to bring it to life with your hook skills!*

## Your chat app building mission üõ†Ô∏è

**üéØ What you need to implement**: This is like being given the frame of a house and getting to wire all the electricity and plumbing! The basic structure is there, but you need to add:

- **useState hooks** to remember the messages and what's being typed
- **Event handlers** so the app responds when users type and click
- **Smart button logic** so the submit button only works when there's actually a message to send
- **Message management** so new messages get added to the chat history

**üîç Your building blocks**: You've learned every piece you need:
- From your earlier exercises: How to use useState to remember things
- From your form exercises: How to handle user input and button clicks
- From your list exercises: How to manage and display lists of information

**üí° Why this is such great practice**: This exercise combines everything you've learned into one cohesive app. By the time you're done, you'll have:
- Managed multiple pieces of state simultaneously
- Created a fully interactive user interface
- Built something that works just like real messaging apps
- Proven to yourself that you can build complex, practical applications

**üöÄ The real-world connection**: Every chat app, social media platform, and messaging system works on these exact same principles. You're not just learning concepts - you're learning the building blocks of modern communication apps!
