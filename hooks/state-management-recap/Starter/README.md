# State Management Recap - Starter

## What this exercise teaches

This exercise provides a comprehensive review of React state management using hooks. You'll practice implementing:

- Complex state management for multiple UI elements
- Controlled form components with validation
- Dynamic list rendering with user interactions
- Event handling patterns with modern React

## Key concepts used

- **useState Hook**: Managing multiple pieces of state (input text, message list)
- **Controlled Components**: Form inputs controlled by React state
- **Event Handlers**: Functions for form submissions and input changes
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamic UI based on state conditions
- **Immutable State Updates**: Using spread operator for array updates
- **Form Validation**: Disabling buttons based on input state

## How to run it

1. **Install dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **View the app**: 
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

4. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Expected behavior

When you run this starter exercise, you should see:

- "ReactND - Coding Practice" header with React logo
- A chat application interface with two chat windows
- Input fields for sending messages
- Submit buttons that should be properly enabled/disabled

**ðŸŽ¯ Your task**: This starter template needs you to implement:
- `useState` hooks for managing input text and message list
- Event handlers for form submission and input changes  
- Proper validation logic for the submit button
- State updates that add new messages to the chat

**Current state**: The basic UI structure is in place, but state management and interactivity need to be added.
