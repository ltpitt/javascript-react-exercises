# All Together - Solution

## What this exercise teaches

This exercise demonstrates a comprehensive React application combining all fundamental concepts. You'll see how to:

- Data display with complex object relationships
- State management with hooks
- Controlled form components
- Component composition and props passing
- Event handling and user interactions

## Key concepts used

- **useState Hook**: Managing application state
- **Controlled Components**: Form inputs managed by React
- **Props Passing**: Data flow between components
- **List Rendering**: Dynamic UI based on data
- **Event Handling**: User interaction responses
- **Data Processing**: Working with arrays and objects
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simple parts

## How to run it

1. **Install dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **View the app**: 
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

4. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Expected behavior

When you run this solution, you should see:

- "ReactND - Coding Practice" header with React logo
- A fully functional React application with all concepts integrated
- Interactive forms and dynamic data display
- Proper state management and component communication

**âœ… Solution highlights**: This complete solution demonstrates how all React fundamentals work together including:
- Complex state management with multiple data types
- Form handling with controlled components
- Dynamic list rendering with proper key management
- Component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Event handling patterns throughout the application
