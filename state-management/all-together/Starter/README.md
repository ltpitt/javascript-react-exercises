# All Together - Starter

## What this exercise teaches

This exercise serves as a comprehensive review of React fundamentals. You'll apply everything you've learned to build a complete application including:

- Data display with complex object relationships
- State management with hooks
- Controlled form components
- Component composition and props passing
- Event handling and user interactions

## Key concepts used

- **useState Hook**: Managing application state
- **Controlled Components**: Form inputs managed by React
- **Props Passing**: Data flow between components
- **List Rendering**: Dynamic UI based on data
- **Event Handling**: User interaction responses
- **Data Processing**: Working with arrays and objects
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simple parts

## How to run it

1. **Install dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **View the app**: 
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

4. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Expected behavior

When you run this starter exercise, you should see:

- "ReactND - Coding Practice" header with React logo
- A blank application ready for you to implement features

**ðŸŽ¯ Your task**: This is the starting point for building a comprehensive React application. You'll need to implement:
- Data management for users and their favorite movies  
- Form components for adding new entries
- Display components for showing the data
- State management to tie everything together

This exercise combines all previous concepts into one cohesive application.
