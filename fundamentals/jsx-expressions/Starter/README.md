# JSX Expressions - Starter

## What this exercise teaches

This exercise teaches you the fundamentals of JSX expressions in React. You'll learn how to:

- Use JavaScript variables inside JSX with curly braces `{}`
- Display object properties in JSX
- Call functions within JSX expressions
- Embed JavaScript expressions in React components

## Key concepts used

- **JSX Expressions**: Using `{}` to embed JavaScript code in JSX
- **Functional Components**: Modern React component syntax using arrow functions
- **ES6+ Features**: Template literals, object destructuring, and arrow functions
- **Component Props**: How React components receive and use data

## How to run it

1. **Install dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **View the app**: 
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

4. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Expected behavior

When you run this starter exercise, you should see:

- A welcome message with "Welcome to React!"
- Release date information showing "Released in: May 2013"  
- A longer description combining multiple facts about React
- The React logo image

**ðŸŽ¯ Your task**: This is the starting point for learning JSX expressions. Examine the code in `src/App.js` to see how JavaScript variables, object properties, and function calls are embedded in JSX using curly braces.
