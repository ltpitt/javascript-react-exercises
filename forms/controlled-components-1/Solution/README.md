# Controlled Components I - Solution

## What this exercise teaches

This exercise demonstrates controlled components in React forms. You'll learn how to:

- Transform uncontrolled inputs into controlled components
- Use React state to manage form input values  
- Connect input values to component state using the `value` prop
- Handle real-time input changes with event handlers

## Key concepts used

- **useState Hook**: Modern state management in functional components
- **Controlled Components**: React manages the form input state via props
- **Event Handling**: Capturing and responding to user input changes
- **One-way Data Flow**: State flows down, events flow up
- **ES6+ Features**: Arrow functions, destructuring assignment

## How to run it

1. **Install dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **View the app**: 
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

4. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Expected behavior

When you run this solution, you should see:

- A text input with placeholder "Say Something"
- An "Echo:" label below the input
- The input's value displayed in real-time as you type

**âœ… Solution highlights**: This completed solution shows a fully controlled component where the input has both `value={value}` and `onChange={handleChange}` props. React completely controls the input's state, following the controlled component pattern for predictable form behavior.
